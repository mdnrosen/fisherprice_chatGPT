However, it was a very good quality breakfast. My only reservation is the fact it was packed, and bookings look to be advisable, if not essential. I'd happy visit again, but it's unlikely as I normally head out for a fry up on a whim or craving, and so booking up is not really practicable for me.

My research pointed me to this location, so this is where I went. \n\nI went with \"The Works\", as I wanted to try everything. The portions were huge and while I knew I couldn't finish it all, I was determined to try a bit of everything.\n\nI'm typically a picky eater, so my expectations were low for my own ability to enjoy what others would probably consider great. The one items I've had plenty of previous experience with and never did like were the mushrooms. I did try one and true to form, I did not care for it. I then ventured into new territory with the black pudding. I was probably the most nervous about this but found it to be sweeter than expected and quite enjoyable. The same went for the bubble and squeak, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOverall, the meal was great!  The service was also top notch, and I would highly recommend this location and meal to anyone in the area. \n\nThank you, Terry's, for a wonderful introduction into the world of the Fry-Up!

My partner and I stumbled across Terrys Cafe by staying at a hotel nearby. We didnâ€™t want a boring modern hotel breakfast so ventured out, looking for a traditional British Cafe. Although incredibly busy (says it all) we were soon seated and attended to by Harriet. There was so many wonderful breakfast options but we both opted for the Hamlet breakfast, which was plentiful and very tasty! Thereâ€™s just not many places that offer good old tinned tomatoes, bubble & squeak and black pudding! Along with eggs, sausages and bacon, this really was an amazing breakfast! Everything was cooked to perfection. All washed down with a gorgeous cappuccino and my partner had a nice cup of brew!
